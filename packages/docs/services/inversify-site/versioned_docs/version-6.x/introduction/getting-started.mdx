# Getting started

Start by installing `inversify` and `reflect-metadata`:

```bash
npm install inversify reflect-metadata
```

Next, initialize your first container and add some bindings:

:::warning

Make sure to enable [Experimental decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#experimentalDecorators) and [Emit Decorator Metadata](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#emitDecoratorMetadata) options in your `tsconfig.json` to use this library.

The `@injectable` decorator allows both `Katana` and `Ninja` classes to be used as container bindings. The `@inject` decorator provides metadata about `Ninja` dependencies, so the container knows that a `Katana` should be provided as the first argument of `Ninja`'s constructor.

Bindings are provided through the `Container` API.

With these two steps, you are ready to initialize your very first ninja!
