# Plugins

InversifyJS provides a plugin system that allows you to extend the container's functionality. Plugins can add new methods to the container, hook into the container's lifecycle, and interact with the container's internal services.

## Creating a Plugin

:::danger

Plugins are, at the moment, an experimental feature and may change in future releases. Use them at your own risk.

To create a plugin, you need to extend the `Plugin` class from `@inversifyjs/plugin` and implement the `load` method. The `load` method receives a `PluginApi` object that allows the plugin to define new methods on the container and hook into the container's resolution process.

```typescript
import { Plugin, PluginApi, PluginContext } from '@inversifyjs/plugin';
import { Container } from 'inversify';

// Extend the container with plugin defined methods
declare module 'inversify' {
  interface Container {
    myMethod(...args: any[]): string;
  }
}

class MyPlugin extends Plugin<Container> {
  public load(api: PluginApi): void {
    // Define a new method on the container
    api.define('myMethod', (...args) => {
      // Implementation of the method
      return 'Result of myMethod';
    });

    // Hook into the container's plan phase
    api.onPlan((options, result) => {
      // Do something with the plan result
      console.log(`Planning resolution for ${String(options.serviceId)}`);
    });
  }
}
```

## Plugin Context

When a plugin is created, it receives a container instance and a plugin context. The plugin context provides access to the container's internal services:

- `activationService`: Manages the activation handlers for services (binding activation is set in the binding).
- `bindingService`: Manages the bindings in the container.
- `deactivationService`: Manages the deactivation handlers for services (binding deactivation is set in the binding).
- `planResultCacheService`: Manages the cache of plan results.

These services allow plugins to interact with the container's core functionality and provide advanced extensions.

## Registering a Plugin

To use a plugin, you need to register it with the container using the `register` method:

```typescript
const container = new Container();
container.register(MyPlugin);
```

Once registered, the plugin can add methods to the container, hook into the container's lifecycle, and modify the container's behavior.

## Plugin API

The `PluginApi` interface provides the following methods:

### define

```typescript
define(name: string | symbol, method: (...args: any[]) => unknown): void
```

Defines a new method on the container. The method will be available on the container instance after the plugin is registered.

### onPlan

```typescript
onPlan(handler: (options: GetPlanOptions, result: PlanResult) => void): void
```

Registers a handler that is called when the container plans a resolution. This can be used to modify the resolution plan or perform additional actions during the resolution process.

Plugins provide a clean way to extend InversifyJS without modifying its core code, allowing for modular and maintainable extensions.
