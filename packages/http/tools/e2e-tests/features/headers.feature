Feature: headers decorator

The headers decorator allows extracting headers from the HTTP request

  Background: Having a container
    Given a container

    Rule: headers decorator allows extracting HTTP headers
      Scenario: HTTP headers are correctly extracted with headers decorator without parameter name

        Given a warrior controller with headers decorator without parameter name for <method> method
        And a <server_kind> server from container
        And a <method> warriors HTTP request with headers
        When the request is send
        Then the response status code is Ok-ish
        Then the response contains the correct headers information

        Examples:
          | server_kind | method    |
          | "express"   | "DELETE"  |
          | "express"   | "GET"     |
          | "express"   | "OPTIONS" |
          | "express"   | "PATCH"   |
          | "express"   | "POST"    |
          | "express"   | "PUT"     |
          | "express4"  | "DELETE"  |
          | "express4"  | "GET"     |
          | "express4"  | "OPTIONS" |
          | "express4"  | "PATCH"   |
          | "express4"  | "POST"    |
          | "express4"  | "PUT"     |
          | "fastify"   | "DELETE"  |
          | "fastify"   | "GET"     |
          | "fastify"   | "OPTIONS" |
          | "fastify"   | "PATCH"   |
          | "fastify"   | "POST"    |
          | "fastify"   | "PUT"     |
          | "hono"      | "DELETE"  |
          | "hono"      | "GET"     |
          | "hono"      | "OPTIONS" |
          | "hono"      | "PATCH"   |
          | "hono"      | "POST"    |
          | "hono"      | "PUT"     |

      Scenario: HTTP headers are correctly extracted with headers decorator with parameter name

        Given a warrior controller with headers decorator with parameter name for <method> method
        And a <server_kind> server from container
        And a <method> warriors HTTP request with headers
        When the request is send
        Then the response status code is Ok-ish
        Then the response contains the correct headers information

        Examples:
          | server_kind | method    |
          | "express"   | "DELETE"  |
          | "express"   | "GET"     |
          | "express"   | "OPTIONS" |
          | "express"   | "PATCH"   |
          | "express"   | "POST"    |
          | "express"   | "PUT"     |
          | "express4"  | "DELETE"  |
          | "express4"  | "GET"     |
          | "express4"  | "OPTIONS" |
          | "express4"  | "PATCH"   |
          | "express4"  | "POST"    |
          | "express4"  | "PUT"     |
          | "fastify"   | "DELETE"  |
          | "fastify"   | "GET"     |
          | "fastify"   | "OPTIONS" |
          | "fastify"   | "PATCH"   |
          | "fastify"   | "POST"    |
          | "fastify"   | "PUT"     |
          | "hono"      | "DELETE"  |
          | "hono"      | "GET"     |
          | "hono"      | "OPTIONS" |
          | "hono"      | "PATCH"   |
          | "hono"      | "POST"    |
